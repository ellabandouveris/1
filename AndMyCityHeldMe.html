                This sustained investigation has helped me to process growing up in LA. I have been able to visit "spots" that informed and inspired me as a kid. I have been able to commemorate these places as well. Since releasing the book and film, young people have reached out to me sharing that that they were able to relate to the essence of LA youth. I aimed to capture nostalgia while documenting pure the Los Angeles landscape, friendship love, and youth culture.
