            She Peels The Orange And Always Gives Me Half
        </h2>
        <p>
            February 2023. <br> Frame: Reclaimed Wood.
            <br>
            Cushion: Linen, Denim. <br>

            This piece is a collaboration between Sisters, Ella and Tessa Bandouveris. Designed together. Frame
            fabricated in Los Angeles, California by Ella Bandouveris. Cushion fabricated in Berkeley, California
            by Tessa Bandouveris.
            <br>
            </p> <p>
            Rooted in the materiality that forms the structure, we used found and reclaimed wood. The cushion is
            made from patches of Ellaâ€™s favorite jeans from high school and a ream of linen that Tessa has been
            making clothing with for years. Patched and stitched together, the chair reflects the patchwork,
            improvisation, and sharing that comes with being a part of a sisterhood. Us sisters have always had
            a particular interest in furniture design and sculptural functionality, we are excited to be at the
            beginning of many more creative endeavors.
